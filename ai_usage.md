# AI Use in Project

This project used AI tools to assist with code debugging and workflow questions:

- **ChatGPT**: Helped generate example code snippets, troubleshoot errors, and explain analysis steps.
- **Gemini**: Used for code suggestions and workflow guidance within Google Colab.

All outputs from AI were manually verified before being included in the analysis. No AI-generated results are used without verification.
